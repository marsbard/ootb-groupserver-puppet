## User configuration options for GroupServer and the systems it relies
## on.
##
[config]
##
## GroupServer Site
##

# The host name and the port for the new GroupServer site. This could be
# the virtual domain you will have configured in Apache or Nginx. If you
# will not be using another web server, this will the same port as
# zope_host below.
host = <%= @gs_host %>
port = <%= @gs_port %>

# The GroupServer administrator that are created when the initial
# site is set up. The address must exist, and will be tested
# during the install process.
admin_email    = <%= @gs_adm_email %>
admin_password = <%= @gs_adm_password %>

# The support email address for the Example Site. This must exist, it
# will be tested during installation.
support_email  = <%= @gs_supp_email %>

# The email server through which email will be sent. This is used for
# outgoing email only. The incoming email server may be different, and 
# this setting will not affect that.
smtp_host = <%= @gs_smtp_host %>

##
## Zope
##

# This is the hostname and port that Zope will listen on. Zope is the
# application framework that GroupServer is written in. If you are not
# using Nginx, Apache or another webserver in front of GroupServer, you 
# should configure zope_host to listen on an external IP address, and 
# update your firewall.
#
# Beware of IPv6 lookups causing issues with your configuration!
#
zope_host = <%= @gs_zope_host %>
zope_port = <%= @gs_zope_port %>

# The user-name and password for the default Zope Management Interface
# (ZMI) admin user. The password can be changed after GroupServer has 
# been installed. This is *different* to the GroupServer admin user and
# password below.
zope_admin = <%= @gs_zope_admin %>
zope_password = <%= @gs_zope_password %>

##
## Database Storage
##

# The passwords that will be used to connect to the PostgreSQL database for
# storing GroupServer and Zope data. If PostgreSQL is installed on the local
# machine, these will be set by the install script. More advanced setups
# require manual setup. 
pgsql_password = <%= @gs_pgsql_password %>
relstorage_password = <%= @gs_relstorage_password %>

##
## Advanced Configuration Options
##
# These are reasonably likely to be correct. If you have non-standard
# email or database port or authentication configuration, please update
# these. It is worth reviewing these, even if only to know what they are
# set to.
##
# STMP connection informaton
smtp_port = 25
smtp_user =
smtp_password =

# The details of the PostgreSQL databases that will be used to store 
# GroupServer and Zope data. Note that the install script will create 
# these if, and only if, the database is running on the local machine. 
# If it is not, manual setup is required. 
#
# Note: If PostgreSQL 8 *and* PostgreSQL 9 are installed the ports below
#       should be set to 5433
